#WorkoutTimer  
This is React application where you can pick what type of workout you will do, then you can adjust your resting time, your time for taking the set and the amount of sets you will do per exercise.  
The app will calculate how much time you need for your workout.  
You can adjust the time manually by increasing or decreasing with the + and - buttons if you think you can do it in less or you need more time.  
Also you can play sound every time you change some value, or you can turn off the sound by clicking on the icon in the top right corner.  
The app is hosted live here: https://aleksandro-workout-timer.netlify.app/
